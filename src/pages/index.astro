			<p>
				Right now, I'm a UX Developer for
				<Link href="https://corcentric.com">Corcentric,</Link> doing both
				front end development and interface design. I've spent the last year
				creating a design system for a brand new platform of products we're
				developing. As 1 of only 3 designers on the team, I have sole responsibility
				and ownership over the design system, which has been tricky but rewarding.
			</p>
			<p>
				For one of our current products, I created a mini library of CSS
				utility classes in SASS, mostly inspired by Tailwind. Our suite
				of developers primarily focus on back end work, so creating this
				library has been helpful in allowing them to style components
				without needing to dive into our already several thousand line
				long CSS files and add a one off rule.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to Corcentric, I graduated from the University of
				Connecticut in 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media and
				Design. During my time there, I worked as a UX Engineer at
				<Link href="https://greenhousestudios.uconn.edu/">
					Greenhouse Studios,</Link
				> designing and developing
				<Link href="https://sourceryapp.org/">Sourcery</Link> and
				<Link
					href="https://greenhousestudios.uconn.edu/projects/charles-vr"
				>
					CharlesV|R.
				</Link>
				Also while in school, I held 3 summer internships with <Link
					href="https://www.travelers.com/">Travelers</Link
				>working on their design system and several internal dashboards.

			<h3 class="font-extended font-semibold">
				Simply put, I love design.
			</h3>
			<p>I truly think this is one of my biggest strengths, if not #1.</p>
			<p>
				I love the work that I do, which makes it so easy to do it well.
				Learning how to improve isn't just something I do to advance my
				career, it's something I'm naturally compelled to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started my journey into design when I was a teen. I always had
				an interest in coding as that's what my dad did for a job, but I
				had never really coded myself. Since I use the internet so
				often, I wanted to learn how to make websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started by tinkering with some CSS using the browser extension
				Stylebot (which I still use!) and slowly learned just by messing
				around with existing websites.
			</p>
			<h3 class="font-extended font-semibold">I'm quick to adapt.</h3>
			<p>
				Ever since I was a child, I've been a fast learner. Picking up
				new skills and concepts has always come naturally to me, which
				has been a huge asset throughout my life. I think in every
				previous role there's been a new language or framework to learn,
				and I've consistently been able to start making contributions
				quicker than expected.
			</p>
			<div class="space-y-1">
				<p>Currently, I have experience working with:</p>
				<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
					<li>Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS</li>
					<li>Bootstrap, TailwindCSS</li>
					<li>Angular, Vue, Svelte, Astro</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>
				This site uses Astro with the Tailwind integration. My <Link
					href="https://muellr.xyz">portfolio</Link
				> uses Svelte with Tailwind as well. I enjoy using Astro for its
				high performance, and Svelte for its developer experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				While working with Angular or Vue was manageable, in terms of JS
				frameworks, I've actively enjoyed working with Svelte. Astro is
				great for a static site like this, as it gives you the strengths
				of a framework, like components, layouts, and modules, without a
				lot of the performance overhead.
			</p>
			<p>
				I know Tailwind Labs uses a lot of React, so while I've
				unfortunately never used React in a project before, I of course
				know of React, and anticipate I would be able to pick it up
				quite quickly, especially given my experience using other JS
				frameworks.

				code, some simply designs, and some a combo of both. I'd
				recommend looking at my <Link href="https://muellr.xyz"

			<p class="!mb-12">
				Moonsound is a concept for a music player I originally had back
				in 2015 around the LollyDrop days, now reimagined for an
				entirely different design landscape. I'm a big fan of glass and
				blur effects in design, so I took this as an opportunity to
				experiment with those.

				Leisurely is a concept I created in college for a fellow

				focus on the clothes.

				howdoesgrid.work is a simple site I created to aid in the

			<h3 class="font-extended text-2xl font-semibold">Sourcery</h3>
			<p>
				While working for Greenhouse Studios during college, the main
				project I worked on was Sourcery. Sourcery is a webapp that
				grants access to archival documents from anywhere in the world.
				After selecting choosing one of several supported repositories,
				a researcher can submit a document request to a "Sourcer," who
				will attempt to retrieve the document(s) and upload them to
				Sourcery, where the researcher can then view and download them.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a UX Engineer on this project, I handled both design and
				front-end development. This was my first experience using Vue,
				but as I mentioned prior, I was able to pick it up quickly and
				start contributing actual, deployable code within a week.

			<h3 class="font-extended text-2xl font-semibold">LollyDrop</h3>
			<p>
				As an Android nerd, the launch of Google's Material Design in
				2014 was really what got me hooked on design. I loved (and still
				love) the focus on depth and smooth motion. I especially loved
				the look of the new app icons, enough so that I learned how to
				make my own.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2015, I released LollyDrop, a free Android icon pack giving
				apps new and old the Material Design treatment. It eventually
				reached just over 71,000 downloads on the Google Play Store,
				which is more than I ever could have imagined.
			</p>

			<!-- <p>
				CSS in particular feels like a puzzle to be solved. Sometimes
				you have the box to look at, sometimes that final image is just
				sitting in your brain somewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				In practice, I tend to do a bit of both. I jump straight into
				high fidelity mockups â€” Figma makes it too easy â€” conjuring up a
				basic layout and some components, then turning to code to truly
				iterate on the design. I commonly find that actually
				implementing the design can expose flaws that I wouldn't have
				seen otherwise, and new ideas I wouldn't have thought of
				otherwise.
			</p>

			<p>I love puzzles, and I love helping people</p> -->

				Thank you for taking the time to read through this, and I hope

				I am definitely earlier in my career than other applicants will
				be, but I think that's not a bad thing. I'm eager to learn and
				grow, and don't come with a lot of preconceived notions about
				how things should be done.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love the flexibilty and velocity that a small team holds. My
				experience with Greenhouse Studios was with around 15 people
				total, and I loved the amount of freedom that came with that.
				Having trustworthy and skilled coworkers made it easy for things
				to get done, as there didn't have to be a massive ticketing
				system with strict workflows that only some people can create,
				yada, yada, yada.

				I'd love to hear from you, whether it's to talk more about this
				opportunity, or simply if you had any feedback on how I could
				improve!
